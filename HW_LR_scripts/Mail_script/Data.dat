Hello_1	It’s just as well I love eggs.
Hello_2	But I did begin to wonder if the wishing well genie had heard my wish.
Hello_3	After breakfast, I helped tidy up the shop.
Hello_4	Things were as quiet as ever.
Hello_5	I decided to have a word with the wishing well genie.
Hello_6	"I’m still waiting for my wish to come true," I whispered.
Hello_7	Then a thought came to me: if the genie was at the bottom of the well, he might not be able to hear me.
Hello_8	Maybe I should talk a little louder. Or a lot louder.
Hello_9	I decided I might as well shout!
Hello_10	"Give me a sign, give me a sign," the wishing well echoed.
